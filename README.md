# Code Test

## OH NO! We are out of coffee!!!

The idea is that you have free rein to develop an app for managing expenses. Imagine the coffee runs out at the office, so you run out and buy it. Then, of course, you want to get reimbursed through your salary, and you need to make an expense report for that.

## Requirements

An expense should consist of at least:

- **Username**
- **Description**
- **Amount**
- **Date**

## Features

It would be nice if it were possible to:

- List all expenses
- Open/View an expense
- Add new expenses
- Delete expenses
- Change the state of expenses: `InProgress`, `ReadyForApproval`, `Approved`

## Stretch Goals

- Filter by, for example, Username, Description, Amount
- Sort by, for example, Amount and Date
- Attach a receipt (image) along with an expense

## Additional Notes

- It would be good if you could include some unit tests, but it's not a requirement.
- The most important thing is not to finish everything but to make an honest attempt and not spend too much time on the task. A reasonable timeframe should be 4 hours.
- We value clean and testable code.
- Use whatever tech stack you want.
- We think it is suitable to develop this using a frontend and backend.
